gr1c (0.9.0)

  * Begin including a CHANGELOG, mostly following the style of Debian packages.
    Changes here are relative to the release version 0.7.4

  * The deprecated output format tulip0 is not available from the command-line
    tools.  This may break compatibility with old versions of TuLiP.

  * The default output format is now "json" rather than "tulip".  This may break
    compatibility with old versions of TuLiP.

  * Introduction of tool "autman" for working with gr1c aut files.

  * Capability to generate models in Spin Promela.

  * More documentation, including how to verify a strategy with Spin.

  * README and other plaintext files now use Markdown formatting rather than
    reStructuredText.

  * Various bugfixes, notably #14 "System liveness fails when environment has
    forced transition leading out of env liveness"

    discussion on that issue page for instructions about checking whether it
    affects you.
