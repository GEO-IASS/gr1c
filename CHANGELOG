gr1c (0.10.2)

  * Include PID in default logging file name prefix.

  * Support `make -j N` for N > 1 (concurrent jobs in Make).

  * Various improvements to parsing of command-line options: `-vv` is equivalent
    to `-v -v`; report unknown options that begin with `--`; add --version

gr1c (0.10.1)

  * Provide more varied and consistent usage of exit codes.
    (This change occurred as part of 0.10.0.)

  * The file format version switch (-s) of `autman` causes the version number to
    be printed to stdout and return of 0 (success), instead of returning the
    version number as the exit code. (This change occurred as part of 0.10.0.)

  * Default to CUDD 2.5.1

  * Decide BDD constant value from Cudd_Eval() using Cudd_IsComplement(). This
    only concerns internal usage of CUDD by gr1c.

  * Various plugs of memory leaks. These did not affect correctness of output.

gr1c (0.10.0)

  * Stop permitting letters [\]^` after first letter in variable names. This was
    an unintended and undocumented feature of the input syntax.

  * Move programs rg and grpatch to `gr1c rg` and `gr1c patch`, respectively.
    The sub-command-oriented style thus begins in the gr1c suite.

  * Create shell script get-deps.sh to automate fetching CUDD.

  * Offer command-line argument -- to stop reading options.

  * Allow for non-reentrant parser. This improves standard lex,yacc conformance.
    However, reentrant parsers may be introduced again later.

  * Refactor several functions in API to use "_to_" instead "2".

gr1c (0.9.0)

  * Begin including a CHANGELOG, mostly following the style of Debian packages.
    Changes here are relative to the release version 0.7.4

  * The deprecated output format tulip0 is not available from the command-line
    tools.  This may break compatibility with old versions of TuLiP.

  * The default output format is now "json" rather than "tulip".  This may break
    compatibility with old versions of TuLiP.

  * Introduction of tool "autman" for working with gr1c aut files.

  * Capability to generate models in Spin Promela.

  * More documentation, including how to verify a strategy with Spin.

  * README and other plaintext files now use Markdown formatting rather than
    reStructuredText.

  * Various bugfixes, notably #14 "System liveness fails when environment has
    forced transition leading out of env liveness"
    <https://github.com/slivingston/gr1c/issues/14>.  Please consult the
    discussion on that issue page for instructions about checking whether it
    affects you.
