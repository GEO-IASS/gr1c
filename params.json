{"name":"gr1c","tagline":"a tool for GR(1) synthesis and related activities","body":"# Introduction\r\n\r\nPlease also consult the README and\r\n[wiki](https://github.com/slivingston/gr1c/wiki).\r\n\r\nBeware the code is still experimental. If you find a possible bug or have comments, suggestions, or feature requests, then please open an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/slivingston/gr1c/issues) or contact Scott Livingston at slivingston@caltech.edu\r\n\r\n# Basic usage\r\n\r\nIn the documentation below, we assume that gr1c is on the shell path. To see a summary of possible command-line arguments,\r\n\r\n    $ gr1c -h\r\n\r\n# Examples\r\n\r\nA very simple and easy to interpret specification is provided in `examples/trivial.spc`.  Stripping away comments, the spec is\r\n\r\n    ENV: x;\r\n    SYS: y;\r\n\r\n    ENVINIT: x;\r\n    ENVTRANS:;\r\n    ENVGOAL: []<>x;\r\n\r\n    SYSINIT: y;\r\n    SYSTRANS:;\r\n    SYSGOAL: []<>y&x & []<>!y;\r\n\r\nThe only environment variable is ``x``, and the only system variable is ``y``; both are Boolean-valued. We initialize both of these to ``True`` and, given the assumption that the environment will infinitely often set ``x`` to ``True``, we must ensure that there are infinitely many states visited such that both ``y`` and ``x`` are ``True``, and such that ``y`` is ``False``.  Obviously there must be at least two states in any play winning for the system because the two guaranteed formulas (``y&x`` and ``!y``) cannot simultaneously be ``True``.  Finally, there are no restrictions on transitions by the environment or the system. Equivalently, the safety components of the assumption and guarantee are ``True``.  This is indicated in the specification by ``ENVTRANS`` and ``SYSTRANS`` being empty.  To check whether the spec is realizable,\r\n\r\n    $ gr1c -r  examples/trivial.spc\r\n\r\nYou should see a message indicating realizability, such as \"Realizable.\" Now, to synthesize a strategy for it, output the result into a [DOT](http://www.graphviz.org/) file, and create a PNG called ``temp.dot.png`` from that output, try\r\n\r\n    $ gr1c -t dot examples/trivial.spc > temp.dot\r\n    $ dot -Tpng -O temp.dot\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
