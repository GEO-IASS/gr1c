Example specifications in the root (i.e., the ``examples`` directory)
are internally documented with comments.  Other examples appear in
subdirectories:

  Examples from N. Piterman, A. Pnueli, and Y. Sa'ar (2006). Synthesis
  of Reactive(1) Designs. *In Proc. 7th International Conference on
  Verification, Model Checking and Abstract Interpretation*.  Run
  gen_arbspec.py (a Python script) to generate specification for case
  of N input lines (i.e., N requests and N possible grants).
  gen_liftspec.py is used similarly but for case of N floors in "lift
  controller" specification.
